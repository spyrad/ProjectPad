# Mobile Navigation Specification

I decided on option #3. As a frontend, React and Tailwind specialist, create a business specification of changes in the @TwoPane.tsx component. Add information about @tech-stack.md. The specification should not contain implementation details, but only references to components. Make sure that the behavior of panels in desktop mode will not be violated.

Extend the proposed change to hide the classic footer @Footer.tsx in favor of mobile navigation on small screens.

Save the specification in the file in the .ai/ui/mobile-navigation.md folder
