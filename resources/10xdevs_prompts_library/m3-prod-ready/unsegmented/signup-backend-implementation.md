# Signup Backend Implementation

Using @supabase-auth.mdc implement the backend under the page @signup.astro and component @SignupForm.tsx

The logic should be consistent with @login.astro and @LoginForm.tsx

Take into account the behavior of supabase - after registration, a link will be sent to confirm the account by the user - inform about this.
