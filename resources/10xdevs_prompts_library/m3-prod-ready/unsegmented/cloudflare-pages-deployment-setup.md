# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Setup

You are a GitHub Actions and Cloudflare specialist.

1) Review the project:

- Tech Stack @tech-stack.md
- Current project configuration @astro.config.mjs
- Dependencies and scripts @package.json
- Available environment variables @.env.example

2) Adapt the project to support deployment to Cloudflare

3) Create a CI/CD scenario "master.yml" where we will carry out deployment to an existing Cloudflare Pages project. Base on @pull-request.yml but in the new scenario do not test E2E.

4) At the end, fix the scenario using @github-action.mdc
