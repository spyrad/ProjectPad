# Login Backend Integration Planning

Integrate @login.astro @LoginForm.tsx with the Astro backend based on the specification @auth-spec.md. Start by analyzing the existing code in the context of best practices @astro.mdc and @react.mdc

The presented plan should meet the assumptions outlined in the user stories section: @project-prd.md

Use @supabase-auth.mdc to achieve correct integration of the login process with Supabase Auth.

Before we start, ask me 5 key technical questions addressing unclear elements of integration that will help you carry out the entire implementation from start to finish.
