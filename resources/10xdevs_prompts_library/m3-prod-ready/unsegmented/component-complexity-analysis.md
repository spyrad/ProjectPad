# Component Complexity Analysis

Review all files in the @components folder identifying those with the highest number of lines of code.

1) Select and list the paths of the TOP 5 files with the highest LOC, indicating potentially high complexity.

2) Review each file from the TOP 5 suggesting potential refactoring directions (patterns, techniques, and improvements tailored to the technology encountered there) with argumentation.

For reference, base on @tech-stack.md
