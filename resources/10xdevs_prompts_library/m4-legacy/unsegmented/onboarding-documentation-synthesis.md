# Onboarding Documentation Synthesis

You are a senior developer tasked with enhancing the onboarding documentation for the Excalidraw project. You have completed both module-level and file-level analyses, and now need to synthesize these findings to update the original onboarding document.

Please review:
1. Your module analysis findings
2. Your key files analysis findings
3. The original onboarding document:
<onboarding-document>
{{onboarding-md}} - pass reference to onboarding documentation

</onboarding-document>

Based on your comprehensive analysis, update the following sections of the  document with deeper insights:

1. Core Modules
   - Enhance the description of each module with insights from your analysis
   - Add any missing modules you discovered that weren't in the original document
   - Include relationships between modules that weren't previously documented

2. Key Contributors
   - Update with accurate contributor information from git history
   - Note areas of expertise/focus for major contributors
   - Identify which contributors are most active in which areas

3. Overall Takeaways & Recent Focus
   - Synthesize patterns discovered in git commits across files and modules
   - Highlight the current development priorities based on recent activity
   - Note any shifts in focus compared to what was stated in the original document

4. Potential Complexity/Areas to Note
   - Flag specific files or modules with high change rates that might indicate complexity
   - Identify areas where multiple contributors frequently make changes (potential knowledge sharing needs)
   - Note any discrepancies between documented architecture and actual implementation

5. Questions for the Team
   - Based on your analysis, formulate 3-5 specific questions that would help a new developer understand unclear aspects of the codebase
   - Focus on areas where the documentation doesn't align with observed code patterns

6. Next Steps
   - Provide concrete recommendations for a new developer joining the project
   - Suggest which files/modules should be reviewed first based on your analysis
   - Recommend specific documentation improvements

Create a revised onboarding document that maintains the overall structure of the original, but enhances these sections with your new findings. The document should be comprehensive yet concise, suitable for helping new developers quickly understand the project landscape.

When updating each section, clearly indicate:
- What information was preserved from the original
- What new insights were added based on your analysis
- Any corrections to the original documentation

Don't return new version as a text, but update the existing @onboarding.md file.
