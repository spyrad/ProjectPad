# DDD - Bounded Context Implementation

Based on the strategic analysis of the {{STRATEGY}} project, implement a Bounded Context named {{CONTEXT_NAME}} in accordance with DDD best practices.

Implement the new functionality using the {{TECH_STACK}} stack — it should be compatible with {{REFERENCE_FILES OR API ENDPOINTS}}.
