<tech-stack>
{{tech-stack}} <- enter your stack description here
</tech-stack>

Conduct a critical but objective analysis of whether <tech-stack> adequately addresses the needs in @prd.md. Consider the following questions:
1. Will the technology allow us to quickly deliver an MVP?
2. Will the solution be scalable as the project grows?
3. Will the cost of maintenance and development be acceptable?
4. Do we need such a complex solution?
5. Is there a simpler approach that would meet our requirements?
6. Will the technology allow us to ensure proper security?
