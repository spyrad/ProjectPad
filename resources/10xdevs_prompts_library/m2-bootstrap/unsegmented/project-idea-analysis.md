# Project Idea Analysis

<project-idea>
{{DESCRIPTION}} - brief description of the idea you're considering
</project-idea>

I'm a developer analyzing a project idea that I'll be working on as part of the 10xDevs course. I'm interested in analysis based on the following criteria:
1. Does the application solve a real problem?
2. Can the application focus on 1-2 key features?
3. Am I able to implement this idea within 6 weeks working on it after hours with AI?
4. Potential difficulties

Before proceeding with the idea analysis, ask me about my experience, preferred tech stack, and other relevant matters that will impact the project implementation.
