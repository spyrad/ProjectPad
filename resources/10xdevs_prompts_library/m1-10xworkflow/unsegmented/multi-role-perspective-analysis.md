# Multi-Role Perspective Analysis

I'm considering {{introducing an intensive testing stage before deployment, working in Agile methodology}}.

Your task is to sense the reception of this idea by individual members of my team, namely:

a) frontend developer
b) security specialist
c) Chief Revenue Officer

Consider how my idea will affect their daily work and priorities and motivation for effective work in the long term. Present each person's observations in separate sections. In case of negative reception by at least one of these roles, propose a more favorable alternative aligned with best practices.
