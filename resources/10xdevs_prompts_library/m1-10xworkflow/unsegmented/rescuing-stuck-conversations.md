# Rescuing Stuck Conversations

Let's pause for a moment and analyze the conversation so far. I feel that instead of getting closer to a solution, we're starting to go in circles and introducing more problems than solving.

I need from you a detailed, objective summary of our work so far that will help me start a new conversation with clean context. Focus on specifics, not generalities.

**What works and should be kept:**
Describe all elements that were correctly implemented and don't require changes. For each element explain why it works well and what specific requirement it meets.

**Where our approach failed:**
Identify moments in this conversation where we started going astray. What implementation decisions turned out wrong? Which repair attempts worsened the situation instead of improving it? Be specific - instead of "code doesn't work", describe precisely what behavior we observe, what we expect, and what specific errors occur.

**What we learned:**
What new information we discovered during experiments? Which of the original assumptions turned out incomplete or imprecise? Did additional requirements or limitations appear we didn't consider initially?

**Updated problem context:**
Based on all the above conclusions formulate a complete problem description what I should provide in a new conversation. This description should be detailed enough that an independent developer could understand what exactly we're trying to achieve, without access to this conversation.
