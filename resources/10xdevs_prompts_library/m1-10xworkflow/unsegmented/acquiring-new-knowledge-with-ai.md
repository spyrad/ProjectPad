# Acquiring New Knowledge with AI

You are an experienced {{DevOps Engineer}} - with your help I would like to understand a new topic.

My knowledge level: {{advanced}} in {{JavaScript}} technology.
I have {{6 years}} of experience with {{React, Redux, and Jenkins}}.

Learning goal: I want to understand {{GitHub Actions}} to {{build the first CI/CD scenario in a GitHub repository}}.

I'm encountering the following blocker: {{I don't understand the difference between job and workflow and on what system tasks should be run - Ubuntu or Windows?}}.

Please explain this topic step by step, starting from {{basics}} and moving to {{advanced aspects/practical application}}.

I learn best through {{problem visualizations and practical diagrams}}.
I prefer an answer in the form of {{brief guide with examples/detailed explanation with comments/demo project/series of exercises with increasing difficulty}}.

Can you help me understand this topic and get unstuck in learning?
