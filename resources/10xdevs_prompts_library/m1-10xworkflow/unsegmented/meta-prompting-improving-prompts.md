# Meta-Prompting - Improving Prompts

You are a world-class expert in prompt engineering. Your task is to analyze and rewrite the following non-working or ineffective prompt to make it precise, context-rich, and fully understandable for a language model.

Current problems we need to address:
- Model doesn't stick to the specified response length
- Model hallucinates and randomly assigns framework X version

When improving the prompt, focus on the following elements:
1.  **Role Assignment:** Propose a specific role or persona for AI (e.g., "You are a senior Python developer", "Act as a marketing expert").
2.  **Adding Context:** Enrich the prompt with essential information that helps the model understand the purpose and background of the task.
3.  **Specifying the Goal:** Sharpen the prompt's objective to be unambiguous.
4.  **Defining the Format:** Specify the exact output format of the response (e.g., Markdown table, JSON list, code snippet).
5.  **Adding Constraints:** Introduce rules and limitations that guide the response (e.g., "Don't use library X", "The answer should be concise").

After rewriting the prompt, in a separate section titled "Explanation of Changes", briefly describe why you introduced these modifications and how they will affect the quality of the response.

Here is the prompt to improve:
